## 1.0.6
* Upgrade to WonderPush Android SDK FCM v1.0.6

## 1.0.5

* Upgrade to WonderPush Android SDK FCM v1.0.5
  * Check for other conflicting `FirebaseMessagingService`s and provide with resolution stategies right from logcat.
* Replace JCenter repository with Maven Central

## 1.0.4

* Update to WonderPush Android SDK FCM module v1.0.4:
  * Declare missing exported attribute for Android 12 compatibility

This update is required if your application uses `targetSdk 31`.
This releases fixes the following build error:

```
Manifest merger failed : Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required
to specify an explicit value for android:exported when the corresponding
component has an intent filter defined.
```

See [the related Android 12 change](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exported).

## 1.0.3

* Update to WonderPush Android SDK FCM module v1.0.3:
  * Upgrade `firebase-messaging` to get rid of a dependency on pre-AndroidX support libraries. Without this change you needed to use `android.enableJetifier=true`.
  * Upgrade `firebase-messaging` to be compatible with versions 22+, as they replaced their Instance ID SDK with their Installations SDK.
    WonderPush failed to retrieve a push token with such versions of the dependency. This only affected users that depended on Firebase outside of WonderPush if one of their dependencies forced the `firebase-messaging` to use version 22+.

## 1.0.2

If you faced one of these errors:

```
W/WonderPush.Push.FCM.FCMPushService: The Google Play Services have not been added to the application
    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.google.android.gms.common.GooglePlayServicesUtil
     Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.google.android.gms.common.GooglePlayServicesUtil" on path: DexPathList[â€¦]
D/WonderPush.Push: Used push service: (none)
```

```
E/WonderPush: Failed to show the notification
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid notification (no valid small icon)
```

then this update is for you.
Other users are encouraged to update too.
